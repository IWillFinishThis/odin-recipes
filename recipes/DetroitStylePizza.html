    <h1>Detroit Style Pizza</h1>
    <img src="./Detroitstylepizza.jpeg" alt="A perfect looking Detroit Style Pizza">
    <h4>A Detroit Style Pizza comes from the traditional Sicilian Style Pizza. It has a thick
        crust with lots of toppings. What makes a Detroit Style a Detroit Style is the fluffiness 
        of the crust, the burnt cheese edges, and many would say the use of Brick Cheese. However,
        Brick Cheese is hard to find so I tend to use cheddar, jack, and mozz.</h4>
